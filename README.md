# Dreamy-Paradise

I am a dreamy person who like to immerse myself in beautiful places in Sai Gon. The app is used to store the list of popular bars around the city. It contains the name, address, the time (opens / closes), the description and the barâ€™s coordinator on the map to that bar as well. Last year, it had been tough since the lockdown was established due to Covid-19. Everyone stayed at home to not spread out the disease. Therefore, I want to make this app as a list of well-known places to chill out so people can drop by during their free time in the evening. To use the app, the user must understand the views of the app.

App has five views:
* Splash View (Extra feature)

First, when the user enters the app, there is a splash screen appearing around 1-2 seconds and navigate to the Home Page.
In the Home Page, there is a tab component to switch between the Home Page and the List Page.

* Home View (Extra feature)

The Home Page shows the different type of places and group them together. You can tap into different bar to see the information of that bar like address, name, time and website.

* List View

The List Page contains all the loaded places.

* Information View

The Information Page contains all the information of the place. In this page, there is also a button to check for the location of the place on the map.

* Map View (Extra feature)

In the future features, I want to build this app like Foody but it is specialized for only that kind of places. It will contain menu and the number of people in the bar. Most importantly, it will allow the booking between the user and the places to be made.
